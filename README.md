## Description

I attempted to a make a tech blog that would allow users to view a homepage and posts other users have made and leave comments on them. I also the was to add a log in feature that allow you to make you own posts in the dashboard. Unfortunately I was not able to finish this in time and it currently can only log in and out.

## Installation

Starting the app from heroku.
